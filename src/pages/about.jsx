                <p>
                    The <strong>Rural Medical Practitioner Council of India (RMPCI)</strong> is a government-registered organization dedicated to the upliftment and development of medical practices in rural India. Founded with the goal of empowering rural healthcare workers, RMPCI is registered under the SR Act 1982 and the Indian Trust Act 1882.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our council supports alternative systems of medicine and works to improve healthcare accessibility across remote villages and underserved regions. We believe that quality medical education, training, and community engagement can make a significant difference in the health outcomes of rural populations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RMPCI is composed of professionals from various disciplines including Allopathy, Homeopathy, Unani, Physiotherapy, and other allied sciences. Our aim is to provide recognition, resources, and research-based education that equips rural medical practitioners with the knowledge and skill to serve their communities effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also committed to complying with constitutional provisions under Article 19(1)(g) and Article 30, upholding the right to educate and practice in the field of alternative medicine.

                <p>
                    Foundation of this organization laid only to establish standard medical education, responsibilities and proper awareness to the health care provider persons in our society which is totally unorganized and neglected by all the allied govt. authorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This community is completely unorganized. The common people of the society consider such practitioners as social workers as well as self-reliant people. But for some people with double-eyed eyes, these practitioners are intolerable. Since people feel that instead of being doctors, they act like doctors. Surprisingly, when people fall in danger in terms of their health conditions, they turn to these unlicensed practitioners at late night and request for immediate medical service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately there are people and even many famous doctors or reputed organizations who admit that without these rural practitioners the society is helpless. Our nation is a country with huge population, big geographic size and diversity. Due to this reason it is very difficult or impossible to fully provide medical services in government or private way to this huge population of India. When people are in danger and adverse conditions, they are quick to find ways and means to get rid of the trouble caused by their anxiety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even after seeking tremendous positive breakthroughs in healthcare services, the villagers in remote villages of rural India still have to travel 20-40 km to get good health services. In some cases, the patient dies on road. What should a person of rural India do in such diverse situations? Must he save his family, or find out where a licensed doctor is? In such a situation, the unlicensed village practitioner, also called hammer doctors or Quack doctors become gods for the villagers because these doctors with their little knowledge treat patients in utmost emergency when there is no other way out. They do basic nursing, heal the disease and save the life of the person suffering from extreme health conditions. The rural people know that they are not licensed doctors; still they go to the rural practitioner, because everyone wants their patient to get quick relief from unwanted situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our country is having huge infrastructure and modern setup, but due to vast geographical area govt. are unable to provide proper service. Geographical and financial conditions are responsible for the outcome of such situations. It is not possible to treat the huge population with licensed doctors at every corner of the country even with minimum infrastructural medical facility. We are not cursing anyone for these unprevailing conditions, since we believe that everything that is happening is our destiny. Time is mistreated and in many situations wrong treatments are made due to lack of knowledge. As a result, at the end we are victims of circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The definition of correct treatment and wrong treatment</strong> - In every field of medical treatment, there are right and wrong treatment results. While diagnosing the disease, the patient is losing life. Even after the diagnosis, by the time right medicine is being prescribed the patient's condition worsens. Also after prescribing right medicine, if on time medicines are not provided, the patient dies. We leave everything on luck and destiny as we are helpless. Also all the blame goes on the rural practitioners, because there is no evidence of their truthfulness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It can be said with utmost faith that if the rural doctors stop providing health care services, there will be a lot of trouble and howl in the medical emergency services in the whole of rural India. We refrain that crores of people across India are engaged in this service, which is considered as an indirect self-employed service. The Government, Law, events etc., are made in the urge of survival and sustainable development of living beings on earth. Living beings come first, followed by government, laws, events and regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the question will arise if someone dies due to wrong treatment, who will take the responsibility? To realize about the term ‘responsibility’ every situation must be thought about and considered, because everything has a tolerance level, nothing is 100% correct and definite. Does any vaccine or medicine have 100% efficiency? Answer is NO. Still we are getting vaccinated and taking medicines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A true fact is that: What the common people have accepted cannot be breathed out by coercion or force. So the system that is going on cannot be stopped or if it is stopped directly or indirectly a lot of damage will be done at different levels of the society. Without threatening these people and the system in the eye of law and de-motivating them, if they are brought in the right way i.e. they are organized together in proper manner, proper education is imparted to them, separate laws are made in favour of them, right education and knowledge are served to them, preparing them to deal with unavoidable emergencies and providing a minimum recognition to their abilities, and legally binding a knot to their periphery of services (crossing limits and going beyond this may be punishable offence under law), it seems that both sides will get saved and a harmony may prevail in the society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today the dishonest people are in the penitentiary, not in the jail. These rural practitioners are not doing any anti-social work, they are by their little knowledge or intelligence wanting to benefit the society. Any accident caused while serving a patient is purely unintentional. There is no practitioner in the society who will intentionally cause harm to himself or humanity by creating an unfortunate incident.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On account of the personal greed of few people of the society, the entire rural practitioner community must not be insulted. It is not right to think that they are greedy or selfish. These categories of people also have mission, vision and a pure mentality to serve mankind. They also deserve to get the desired place in the society and the right to live a decent social life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the eyes of law, 100 dishonest people may not be punished, but one honest person should not get punishment. Will this proverb work in the case of the patients? Let 100 patients who die, let them die, but no one should receive wrong treatment. Humans make mistakes, and there are mistakes in the scriptures too. These words ‘wrong’ and ‘right’ are purely relative terms, which can only be argued, not resolved. So let us focus for a better rural medical service of India. This is possible only when registered rural practitioners association can work with dedication without facing any hindrances.
